  <h2>Latin Worksheet Verbs</h2>
 
  <p>The worksheet process allows you to generate a list of Latin verbs to test yourself or your students.</p>

  <p><a href="{{ url_for('latin.worksheet.verbs.create') }}"><button>Create a worksheet</button></a></p>

  <h3>Are the worksheets free to use?</h3>
  <p>Yes, they're free to use and no attribution is required. You can use them for personal study, in schools and universities, and for private tuition. If you charge fees to your students I appreciate, but do not require, a donation to <a href="https://classicsforall.org.uk/" target="_blank">Classics for All</a> as a thank you. The worksheets are not affiliated with or endorsed by Classics for All, but I want to support the work they do.</p>

  <h3>Why are you doing this?</h3>
  <p>Several reasons:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Creating the verb tables makes me practise Latin.</li>
    <li>I use the worksheets to test my own Latin knowledge.</li>
    <li>It demonstrates my web application skills (which I use in my freelance business).</li>
    <li>It costs me nothing to make the worksheets available to a wider audience.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I also come from a family of teachers and have seen how much work goes into lesson planning. Any part of planning that can be automated to reduce the workload is a good thing.</p>

  <h3>Where do the translations come from?</h3>
  <p>I've translated all the verb forms myself, based on my current level of Latin knowledge.</p>

  <h3>I've spotted a translation mistake!</h3>
  <p>Great! Please <a href="{{ url_for('contact') }}">send me an email</a> and I'll fix it as soon as I can.</p>

  <h3>How are the worksheets generated?</h3>
  <p>All the possible combinations (person + number) of the verbs you select are calculated, then one is picked out at random until the number of desired exercises has been met or there are no more combinations available. Combinations are never repeated within Latin to English or English to Latin on the same worksheet, but the same combination may appear on both sets of exercises. For example, you won't be asked to translate 'laboro' to English twice, but you may be asked to translate 'laboro' to English and 'I work' to Latin.</p>
  <p>A rough analogy is how revision cards work, where you shuffle the deck and then pick cards from the top.</p>
  <p>As the worksheets are generated at random, you will get a different worksheet each time, even if you select the same verbs.</p>

  <h3>Are the worksheets saved anywhere?</h3>
  <p>No. If you want to keep a copy of a worksheet, the easiest way is to use the Print to PDF functionality in your web browser.</p>

  <h3>What tenses are supported?</h3>
  <p>Only the present indicative tense at the moment, as that's the extent of my Latin knowledge. I will add more tenses over time as my Latin improves.</p>

  <h3>Why is there only one English translation?</h3>
  <p>To keep things simple and consistent, I've only added one English translation for each Latin verb form. For example, 'laboro' is translated as 'I work' rather than 'I am working'.</p>

  <h3>How do you decide which verbs to support?</h3>
  <p>The supported verbs are ones that I'm familiar with and have sufficient confidence to translate in all forms in the present indicative tense. I am learning Latin from a variety of sources and at my own pace, so the supported verbs won't necessarily align with a particular exam board or specification.</p>

  <h3>Can I suggest verbs to be added?</h3>
  <p>Not at the moment. I'm adding verbs as I learn them, so the most common verbs will find their way into the worksheets over time.</p>

  <h3>Can you create worksheets for nouns, adjectives etc.?</h3>
  <p>Yes, this is on my medium-term list. I've concentrated on verbs for now as a single Latin verb can form a sentence on its own.</p>
