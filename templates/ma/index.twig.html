  <h2>MA Ancient World Studies</h2>

  <p>In 2006 I decided it would be fun to follow my Computer Science undergraduate degree with a postgraduate degree in Ancient World Studies. This involved me attempting to learn Latin (badly) and Greek (abandoned after a few weeks), as well as writing two essays and a dissertation, and delivering a presentation. Despite coming to the subject with no relevant qualifications, I passed the course and received my degree in 2007.</p>
