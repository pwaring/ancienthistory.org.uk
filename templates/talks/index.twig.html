  <p>If you would like me to give a talk at your local group, <a href="{{ url_for('contact') }}">drop me an email</a> and I'll see what I can do. Please bear in mind that I work full time and don't make any money out of speaking or writing about history, so the number of talks I can give is limited.</p>
